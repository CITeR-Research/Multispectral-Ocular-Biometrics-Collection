# WVU: Multispectral Ocular Biometrics Collection Release Agreement

Please contact: Jeremy Dawson, Jeremy.dawson@mail.wvu.edu

The goal of the Multispectral Ocular Biometrics Dataset is to aid researchers in their work, to develop, train, test and evaluate the human recognition algorithms for ocular biometrics:
1. To investigate the use of the sclera texture and vasculature patterns evident in the sclera as biometric cues.
2. To improve the performance of non-frontal iris recognition by adding details pertaining to the sclera region. Iris patterns are better discerned in the near infrared spectrum (NIR) while vasculature patterns are better discerned in the visible spectrum (RGB). Therefore, multispectral images of the eye, consisting of both NIR and RGB channels, are used to ensure that both the iris and the vasculature patterns are imaged.
3. To investigate the use of the periocular region as a soft biometric.
